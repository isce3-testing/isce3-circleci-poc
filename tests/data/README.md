# Test Data

This README gives brief descriptions on the generation of various test data
found in this directory.

## Winnipeg

- The original product from which the test data are generated: winnip_31604_12061_004_120717_L090_CX_129_05.h5
  This is a UAVSAR NISAR simulated product. Check science/LSAR/identification/productVersion to get the product version
  As for NISAR data/ Simulated NISAR data have to be intended as zero-doppler

- All winnipeg-related "reference" products in this folder (e.g. warped_winnipeg.slc) have been generated using ISCE2 v2.3.
  The ISCE2 processing uses "winnip_31604_12061_004_120717_L090_CX_129_05.h5" as reference and secondary SLC to create the golden/reference dataset.

## Attitude

Attitude sample data in NISAR format (see JPL D-102264) was provided by the
G&C team (Dave Bates, et al) during NASA Internal Thread Test 04 (NITT-04)
activities in late 2020/early 2021. The hash of the original file delivered
by email is

```
$ md5sum NISAR_ANC_L_PR_FRP_20210114T023357_20200107T200000_20200109T040000.xml
2101bddf088d3b4e8e0e3051931f8284  NISAR_ANC_L_PR_FRP_20210114T023357_20200107T200000_20200109T040000.xml
```

To reduce the size of the test data, this file was trimmed to the first ten
records to produce `attitude.xml`.

## Orbit

Orbit sample data in NISAR format (see JPL D-102253) provided by Paul Ries
via email on 2020-07-06. It was generated from Jason2 data. The hash of the
original file is

```
$ md5sum -b smoothFinal.xml.gz
f415fc38e1feff0bb1453782be3d2b5f *smoothFinal.xml.gz
```

This file was uncompressed and trimmed to the first ten state vectors in
order to reduce the size of the `orbit.xml` file stored here.

## REE

Multi-channel L0B Raw data and HDF5 antenna pattern cuts (NISAR antenna format *v2*)
initially generated by Radar Echo Emulator tool, [*REE*](https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/SALSA-REE/REE_SRC),
and then post-processed and converted into L0B product via its python utility tool
[*ReeUtilPy*](https://github.jpl.nasa.gov/SALSA-REE/ReeUtilPy).
Note that these files may be stored in a separate location outside *isce3* repo.

- **REE_ANTPAT_CUTS_BEAM4.h5**

  Four-beam *NISAR* antenna pattern file. The original full *2-D* version of patterns
  come from datasets for case of *Case4g19c* generated by NISAR antenna team and stored
  on *JPL NISE* machine.
  This file contains the first four NISAR-like beams (nearest range ones).
  It containes both elevation and azimuth cuts of both polarizations *H* and *V*.

- **REE_L0B_CHANNEL4_EXTSCENE_PASS1_LINE3000.h5**

  Truncated version of first pass of repeat-pass four-channel *V*-polarized NISAR-like
  simulated *REE* L0B product over heterogenous urban-like simulated extended scene.
  The total number of truncated range lines is *3000*.
  The range bins has also been truncated from original datasets to get rid of far-range
  bins where there exist simply noise plus TX gap.
  This dataset is suitable for demonstrating formation of three null patterns in elevation
  direction used in elevation pointing over heterogenous scene.

## ALOS1

- **ALOS1_PALSAR_ANTPAT_FIVE_BEAMS.h5**

  Antenna pattern cuts (NISAR antenna format *v2*) for five beams centered at off-nadir
  angle around *34.0 deg*.
  The elevation-cuts for several beams are provided by *ESA* via M. Lavalle
  while the azimuth-cut is simply generated by H. Ghaemi from *Fig.3*[1].

- **ALPSRP081257070-H1.0__A_HH_2500_LINES.h5**

  L0B-formatted *HH* raw *PALSAR* data collected by *ALOS1* over Amazon rain forest.
  This dataset corresponds to beam # *7* of *ALOS1* centered at off-nadir angle around
  *34.0 deg*. This data corresponds to beam/channel # *3* in the above HDF5 antenna file.
  There are total *2500* range lines.
  The scene is cosidered homogenous suitable for antenna pattern measurement in
  elevation direction.
